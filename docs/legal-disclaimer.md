## Anti-Cheat Systems

### Important Warning

Modern anti-cheat systems (BattleEye, EasyAntiCheat, Vanguard, etc.) are designed to detect and prevent DLL injection. Attempting to bypass these systems:

1. **Will likely fail** - Kernel-level protection is highly effective
2. **Will result in bans** - Permanent account bans are common
3. **May be illegal** - Violates CFAA and similar laws
4. **Violates Terms of Service** - Breach of contract

**We do NOT support or condone bypassing anti-cheat systems.**

## Terms of Service Violations

Using this tool to inject into games or software typically violates:
- End User License Agreements (EULAs)
- Terms of Service (ToS)
- Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs)

**Consequences may include:**
- Account suspension or permanent ban
- Loss of purchased content
- Legal action by game developers
- Criminal prosecution in severe cases

## Ethical Considerations

### Respect for Others

- **Don't ruin others' experiences** - Cheating in multiplayer games harms other players
- **Respect intellectual property** - Developers invest time and money in their creations
- **Play fair** - Unfair advantages undermine competitive integrity

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities using this tool:
1. **Do NOT exploit them maliciously**
2. **Report responsibly** to affected parties
3. **Allow time for patches** before public disclosure

## Educational Context

This tool was created to:
- Demonstrate Windows internals concepts
- Teach PE file format and process memory
- Illustrate security concepts
- Provide practical systems programming examples

**It is a learning tool, not a cheating tool.**

## Getting Permission

### For Security Research

1. **Bug Bounty Programs**
   - Many companies have authorized bug bounty programs
   - Examples: HackerOne, Bugcrowd
   - Follow program rules carefully

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - Get written authorization (scope, timeline, methods)
   - Work under a contract
   - Follow rules of engagement

3. **Academic Research**
   - Obtain IRB approval if involving user data
   - Follow institutional guidelines
   - Use controlled test environments

### For Game Modding

1. **Check EULA/ToS** - Does the game allow modding?
2. **Single-player only** - Never mod online/multiplayer
3. **Respect developer wishes** - Some developers explicitly prohibit all mods
4. **Community guidelines** - Follow modding community standards

## Detection and Consequences

### What Gets Detected

Modern anti-cheat systems can detect:
- DLL injection attempts
- Modified game memory
- Suspicious process behavior
- Known cheat signatures
- Debuggers and analysis tools

### Typical Consequences

1. **Immediate ban** - Often permanent, no appeal
2. **Hardware ban** - Can't create new accounts
3. **Legal action** - Publishers may sue for damages
4. **Criminal prosecution** - In cases of fraud or theft

**Is it worth risking?** No.

## Alternatives to Injection

If you want to modify games:

1. **Official Mod Support** - Use games with official modding APIs
2. **Private Servers** - Play on private servers that allow mods
3. **Save Editors** - Modify save files (where permitted)
4. **Trainer Tools** - Use with offline games only
5. **Game Developer Tools** - Learn to create games instead of modifying them

## Reporting Misuse

If you discover this tool being used maliciously:

1. Report to game developers/publishers
2. Report to anti-cheat providers
3. Report to platform (Steam, Epic, etc.)
4. Contact law enforcement if illegal activity is involved
